        <h2>WHY IT WORKS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chile flakes add heat without distracting flavor, while a smaller dose of black pepper offers just enough musky spice to keep things interesting.</li>
            <li>This quick-cooked sauce is not only fast and easy, it also ensures that the tomato flavor remains bright—a necessary contrast for the rich pork.</li>
            <li>Finishing the pasta in the sauce coats each noodle with plenty of flavor.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step by Step</h2>
        <p>
            To make amatriciana, I start by heating olive oil in a skillet or sauté pan. If you want to brown half an onion in it, you can, though you don't need to. Then I add the guanciale (or, alternatively, pancetta) and pepper flakes and cook the pork until it's slightly crisped and browned. White wine halts the browning and deglazes the browned bits on the bottom of the pan; I cook it down until it's almost all evaporated.<br><br>
            Then I add whole canned tomatoes that I've crushed by hand, along with all their juices. I like the texture of the little bits of tomato left behind by hand-crushing here, but puréeing the tomatoes with a blender is also an option if you want a silky-smooth sauce.<br><br>
            I let the sauce simmer very gently while I boil the pasta. I'm using bucatini, thick spaghetti with a hole through the center of each noodle—a traditional choice, but spaghetti or even penne is a fine substitute. When the pasta is just shy of al dente, I transfer it to the sauce and add a good splash of the pasta cooking water. The starch in the cooking water helps emulsify and bind the sauce.<br><br>
            In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add guanciale and pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add wine and cook, scraping up any browned bits on bottom of pan, until nearly evaporated, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper.<br><br>
            Meanwhile, boil pasta in salted water until just shy of al dente, about 1 minute less than package recommends. Using tongs, transfer pasta to sauce, along with 1/4 cup pasta cooking water. Cook over high heat, stirring and tossing rapidly, until pasta is al dente and sauce has thickened and begins to coat noodles. Remove from heat, add cheese, and stir rapidly to incorporate. Season to taste with more salt and pepper. Serve right away, passing more cheese at the table.

		 <h3>Notes</h3>
		 <p>Guanciale (cured pork jowl) will give the sauce the best texture, but if your best option is good pancetta, use it instead.</p>
		 <p>Bucatini is a type of thick, hollow spaghetti; you can substitute regular spaghetti, or even penne.</p>
